# Extremely-Basic-Wikipedia-Scraper
Basic script that pulls the article title, first paragraph, and last updated information from any Wikipedia article and stores it in a single CSV file. Script only works for one site at a time and checks the target directory for an existing output file before creating or appending the collected data.
